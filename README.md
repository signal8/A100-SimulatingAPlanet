# A100-SimulatingAPlanet
For an assignment, I had to calculate the Mars' past atmosphere, given a handful of equations. 
I thought it would be a fun coding challenge to turn this into a C program, and I figured I'd post
it on Github in case anyone's curious. :3

**Please use caution when using this!** This could be a fictional scenario I was handed, 
and my math could easily be wrong. I wrote this in like, an hour.
